# TUM-eAccess-Redirector
JavaScript Userscript to redirect to the eAccess version (proxyfied) when websites licenced by the Technical University Munich are accessed.

To install use a plugin for your browser like tampermonkey or Greasemonkey. Than visit the script on [Greasyfork](https://greasyfork.org/de/scripts/21778-tum-eaccess-redirector) or copy form here.

### Future plans
Readablility should be improved. <br>
Creating automatic login. <br>
I'm about to create a minified version of the script.
